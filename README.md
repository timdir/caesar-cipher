# caesar-cipher

## INTRODUCTION

This program is an implementation of a basic caesar cipher.  A caesar cipher is used to encrypt messages, although it is an easily broken cryptographic algorithm.  It involves shifting letters a certain number of spaces.  In the past, an alphabet of all capital letters that looped on itself was used.



## HOW TO RUN A .JAR FILE

Double clicking on the caesar.jar file should begin the program. Alternatively, you can run the following command in the directory where the .jar file is located:
java -jar caesar.jar

You may have to install JRE to your machine before you can run a .jar file.



## HOW TO USE IT

To encrypt a message, place your text in the left panel and press the "Encrypt" button.  The encrypted message will appear in the right panel.  

To decrypt a message, place your encrypted text in the right panel and press the "Decrypt" button.  The decrypted message will appear in the left panel.



## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

In this program I used a shift of -8, although this could be modified in the source code.
